% This function is based of non negative matrix factorization identify clusters or latent factors that reveal how
% groups of genes are commonly regulated in response to oxaliplatin
% treatment.
% 
% The input requires a matrix samples by genes: drg_oxa_271_genes.xls 
%  
% Clusters of Genes (Basis Matrix ùëä W):
% 
% By decomposing the data, teh function reveals clusters of genes that tend to be
% co-expressed (or have similar LSmean levels) across the two groups. This
% could point to groups of genes or pathways that are differentially
% regulated in response to oxaliplatin, possibly identifying key pathways
% impacted by the treatment. 
% 
% Clusters of Mice (Loading Matrix ùêª H):
% 
% The loading matrix ùêª H would indicate how each mouse aligns with each
% identified gene cluster. Mice treated with oxaliplatin might load more
% strongly onto certain clusters, reflecting a shared transcriptional
% response pattern, while control mice might align with different clusters.

% Interpreting the Mechanism:
% 
% Once clusters of genes are identified, you can use pathway enrichment
% analysis or gene ontology (GO) analysis to interpret the biological
% processes or pathways these clusters represent. A cluster
% enriched in genes related to DNA repair, apoptosis, or cell cycle
% regulation might suggest that oxaliplatin impacts these mechanisms.
